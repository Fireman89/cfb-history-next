# College Football History

This project aims to provide a comprehensive history of college football, including team records, schedules, and rankings. The application is built using React and TypeScript, with data fetched from various APIs and stored in a database.

## Features

- View team records and schedules
- View conference standings
- View AP rankings
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## TODOs

### 1. Adding Backgrounds for Every Year

- Implement a feature to display different backgrounds for each year.
- Ensure that the backgrounds are responsive and do not affect the readability of the content.

### 2. Adding Admin Login to Manually Adjust Database Records & Dimensions (Optional)

- Create an admin login page.
- Implement authentication and authorization for admin users.
- Provide an interface for admins to manually adjust database records and dimensions.

### 3. View Games in More Detail by Hovering Over Them

- Implement a feature to display detailed information about games when hovering over them.
- Ensure that the hover effect is smooth and does not interfere with other elements on the page.

### 4. Toggle to Sort by Record or Alphabetically

- Add a toggle button to switch between sorting teams by their record or alphabetically.
- Ensure that the sorting is applied consistently across all relevant components.

### 5. Find Other APIs to Query From & Convert

- Research and identify additional APIs that provide relevant data.
- Implement data fetching from the new APIs.
- Convert and integrate the data into the existing application structure.

### 6. Update Logos (e.g., 2023 & Onwards Updates)

- Update team logos to reflect the latest changes (e.g., 2023 updates).
- Ensure that the logos are displayed correctly across all components.

### 7. Add read-only access

- Create Supabass read-only URL for database
- Enable users to clone & use repository without additional configuration or automation.

### 8. Add IP tracking and similar analysis

- Because it's only fair to know who and when people are accessing your site.
